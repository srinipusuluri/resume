## Vision & Direction

My vision is to build the next-gen AI-native CRM platform where CRM systems are no longer passive data stores but active agents. These agents will anticipate sales moves, automate workflows, ingest documents (vision, email, voice), and act autonomously across systems (ERP, marketing, support). I envision architectures with multiple agents collaborating‚Äîone for lead qualification, another for cross-sell recommendations, another monitoring churn signals‚Äîtied through a shared vector store + memory + orchestration layer.

### Future Directions:
- Domain-specific fine-tuned models (healthcare, finance, telco)
- Vision + document ingestion (contracts, invoices scanning)
- Agent orchestration for multi-agent planning
- Feedback loops, self-improvement, drift detection
- Plug-and-play CRM agent modules / micro-apps
