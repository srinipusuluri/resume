# Srinivasa "Srini" Pusuluri - AgenticRM Architect Portfolio

## Elevator Pitch
CRM + Agentic AI expert with deep enterprise architecture foundations. I build intelligent CRM agents, fine-tuned LLMs, vision-enabled assistants, RAG architectures, and hybrid CRM-AI systems that automate complex workflows across sales, service, marketing, and operations.

## About Me
Over 10+ years of experience in enterprise CRM, integration, automation, and AI/ML systems. Hands-on expertise in building agentic systems: autonomous agents, CRM bots, LLMs, multi-modal agents (vision + text). Strong architecture mindset with focus on scalable, modular, secure, observable, and orchestrated solutions.

### Full-Stack Capabilities
- Data pipelines, vector stores, prompt engineering, fine-tuning, agent orchestration, microservices
- Familiar with cloud platforms (AWS, GCP), MLOps, DevOps, and best practices
- Passion: Bridging CRM systems with AI agents to deliver business outcomes (sales acceleration, service automation, predictive insights)

## Key Capabilities & Core Pillars

### Enterprise CRM Architecture
- Data models, modularization, domain separation, microservices, API layers, event-driven architecture

### Agentic AI / Autonomous Agents
- Agent frameworks, tool use, planning & memory, multi-agent collaboration

### LLM & Fine-tuning
- Training, prompt tuning, LoRA, PEFT, custom domain models

### Vision + Multi-Modal Agents
- Integrating image, document, video understanding with CRM context

### RAG / Retrieval-Augmented Systems
- Vector embeddings, chunking, pipelines, context retrieval

### Integration & Orchestration
- CRM systems (Salesforce, Dynamics, HubSpot), APIs, middleware, n8n / Airflow / orchestration

### Security, Observability & Compliance
- Data lineage, audit trails, prompt logging, drift detection, governance

### DevOps / MLOps / Deployment
- CI/CD, containerization, model serving, scaling, monitoring

## Featured Projects & GitHub Repositories

### [aiagents](https://github.com/srinipusuluri/aiagents)
**Library / Sample Set of AI Agent Prototypes**
- Designed modular agent templates (planner, executor, tool invoker)

### [MY-PUBLICATIONS](https://github.com/srinipusuluri/MY-PUBLICATIONS)
**Repository of Papers, Articles, Writeups**
- Thought leadership, technical writing, whitepapers on CRM + AI

## Vision & Direction

My vision is to build the next-gen AI-native CRM platform where CRM systems are no longer passive data stores but active agents. These agents will anticipate sales moves, automate workflows, ingest documents (vision, email, voice), and act autonomously across systems (ERP, marketing, support). I envision architectures with multiple agents collaborating—one for lead qualification, another for cross-sell recommendations, another monitoring churn signals—tied through a shared vector store + memory + orchestration layer.

### Future Directions:
- Domain-specific fine-tuned models (healthcare, finance, telco)
- Vision + document ingestion (contracts, invoices scanning)
- Agent orchestration for multi-agent planning
- Feedback loops, self-improvement, drift detection
- Plug-and-play CRM agent modules / micro-apps

### Features
- Fully responsive design (mobile-first approach)
- Smooth scrolling navigation
- Animated card reveals on scroll
- Modern font stack (Inter, system fonts)
- Clean, professional layout
- SEO optimized with proper meta tags

### Local Development
1. Clone the repository
2. Open `index.html` in your browser
3. Or run a local server:
   ```bash
   python3 -m http.server 8000
   ```
4. Visit `http://localhost:8000`

### Deployment
The site is optimized for static hosting on platforms like:
- GitHub Pages
- Netlify
- Vercel
- Any static web host
